## Practising with APIs
Using APIs with JavaScript.

### Description
This was an optional workshop during the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp. The goal was to try out calling APIs for GET and POST requests, using `fetch`.

I used the old Promise/then syntax rather than the newer async/await, to try to understand Promises.

### JSON Placeholder
It's a [free "fake" API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Can be used for testing.

### Installation and Usage
* Clone this repo
* Navigate into the cloned folder
* Open either of the `index.html` files in your browser
